To synchronize the MP3 and GPX files at the measure level, you'll need to make modifications to the data preprocessing steps. Here's an overview of the changes needed:

1. **Audio preprocessing**: Modify `src/data_preprocessing/audio_conversion.py` to include beat tracking and measure segmentation. This step will output measure-level audio features (e.g., MFCCs).

2. **Tab preprocessing**: Modify `src/data_preprocessing/tab_tokenization.py` to extract measure-level tab information from GPX files. Instead of processing the entire tab file as a single sequence, the updated script should output tokenized tabs for each measure.

3. **Data synchronization**: In `src/data_preprocessing/data_split.py`, synchronize the measure-level audio features and tokenized tabs to create input-output pairs for training.

Now, let's break down the changes needed for each step:

1. **Audio preprocessing**:

- Update `src/data_preprocessing/audio_conversion.py` to include beat tracking using `librosa.beat.tempo` and `librosa.beat.plp` functions.
- Segment the audio into measures based on the time signature from the corresponding GPX file.
- Extract audio features (e.g., MFCCs) for each measure and save them as separate `.npy` files, or as a single file containing a list of measure-level feature arrays.

2. **Tab preprocessing**:

- Modify `gpx_to_tab_text` function in `src/data_preprocessing/tab_tokenization.py` to output measure-level tab information.
- Update the `tokenize_tabs` function to process measure-level tab information and tokenize them using the `TabTokenizer` class.
- Save the tokenized measure-level tabs as separate `.npy` files, or as a single file containing a list of token sequences.

3. **Data synchronization**:

- Update `src/data_preprocessing/data_split.py` to load measure-level audio features and tokenized tabs.
- Ensure that the audio features and tokenized tabs are synchronized (i.e., they correspond to the same measures in the audio and GPX files).
- Create input-output pairs for training, where the input is the audio feature sequence for a measure and the output is the corresponding tokenized tab sequence.

By making these changes, you'll create a dataset with synchronized measure-level audio features and guitar tabs, which can be used to train a model that generates guitar tabs for new audio inputs.
